It is a cool winter morning in the wooded mountains. Small birds are chirping in the snow-clad pines. Occasionally a lump of snow falls and creates a satisfying thump, some of the only movement to be seen for miles.

The crackling of a fire, the chirping of crickets, and the wind rustling through the trees are the perfect backdrop to ending a great day out in the backcountry. As you bundle up in your sleeping bag, your sore feet give a breath of relief to finally have a break after hiking many miles that day. The ambience of the night and the exhaustion of the day help you fall asleep as soon as you close your eyes.

For those who have already taken to satisfying their internal yearning to connect with the natural world, these scenes describe some of the best moments in life. But to most of the world, and perhaps to you, the reader, these are something only to be read about or seen via magazine or documentary. And yet here you are, reading an article on a website dedicated to helping everyone enjoy the beauties which Mother Nature has to offer. 

This past year an incredible amount has changed throughout the world. A Global Pandemic causing us to perhaps spend more time cooped up and alone than we may like. Chaos and hate being spread by many. Natural disasters are destroying homes and lives. There is a lot which could get us down about life, which is a fairly normal response. But it it critically important to remember how much good is out there too! I like to find this outside, enjoying the fresh air and mountain breeze. I believe that the renowned naturalist John Muir said it best, 

“Climb the mountains and get their 
good tidings. Nature’s peace will
flow into you as sunshine flows into
trees. The winds will blow their own
freshness into you, and the storms
their energy, while cares will drop
off like autumn leaves”.

Sometimes we need to escape the business of everyday life and take the simple path, the one less travelled. I hope through this website to help those who are looking to let "nature's peace... flow into [them]" and give you a place to start. Starting something is often the most difficult part of any journey, but it's something that everyone of us has to accomplish. I have found though, that it is always nice to have someone or something to help me along the way.
